# RestAssured Demonstration Project
 
REST Assured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs. This demonstration project configures and runs REST Assured tests against a public (unsecured) API service.

The API service at [numbersapi.com](http://numbersapi.com) provides trivia, maths, date, and year facts about numbers.


### API Tests
Use the provided Gradle wrapper to run tests from command line.
